# FrontKit

My project template for front-end development.

## Create React App

This project is based on the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) TypeScript template.

## Getting Started

Use `npm run check-placeholders` to find all the `___placeholders___` from the template.

You can delete the `check-placeholders` and `postinstall` scripts once they've
all been replaced.
